# Hand Gesture Detection

This project demonstrates a real-time hand gesture detection system using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. The application captures video from the webcam and processes each frame to identify hand landmarks. It then analyzes these landmarks to detect specific gestures, such as a closed fist.

## Features
- **Real-time processing**: The system processes video frames in real-time, providing immediate feedback on detected gestures.
- **Closed fist detection**: The primary feature is to detect when the user forms a closed fist with their hand.
- **User-friendly interface**: The application displays the detected gesture on the screen, making it easy for users to understand the system's output.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- MediaPipe (mediapipe)

## Usage
To run the application, simply execute the provided Python script. Ensure that your webcam is connected and accessible by the application.
